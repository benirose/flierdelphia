# Flierdelphia

Flierdelphia is a website for submitting and finding locations that are good to leave or hand-out fliers for events, community activities, and sales. It was born out of a frustration that every time I had a show I would print 250 fliers and never know where to put the things, ending up with over 100 fliers left after the show. My hope is that it will help build community in Philly around multiple different interest, from music, to non-profits, to neighborhoods.
